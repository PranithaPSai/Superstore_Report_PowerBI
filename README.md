# PowerBI Dashboard Project : Superstore Analysis
This repository contains the Power BI Dashboard project that I created using the Global Superstore dataset. The dashboard provides in-depth analysis and visualizations to gain insights into various aspects of the business.

## Project Overview
The Superstore Power BI Dashboard is a comprehensive business intelligence project designed to analyze global retail data and uncover valuable insights. Using the Superstore dataset, this dashboard provides a clear picture of business performance across sales, profit, customers, and regions.The goal of the project is to transform raw sales data into meaningful visual insights that help stakeholders make data-driven decisions. By leveraging Power BI’s data modeling, DAX calculations, and interactive visualizations, the report highlights key trends, identifies top-performing segments, and monitors delivery performance across regions and time periods.

## Tech Stack
The Dashboard was built using the following tools and technologies:
* Microsoft Power BI Desktop-Main tool used to build interactive dashboards and reports.
* Power Query Editor-Used for cleaning, shaping, and transforming the raw Superstore dataset.
* DAX (Data Analysis Expressions)-Used to create calculated columns, measures, KPIs, and custom metrics.
* Power BI Map Visuals-Enabled visualization of regional and market-level insights across countries.
* File Format- .pbix for development and .png for dashboard previews.
